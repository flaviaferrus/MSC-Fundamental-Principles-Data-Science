    "            + **Generative adversarial networks**: *trick for **guiding a network into mimicking a sampled data distribution**. In a nutshell it consists of a two part process that get repeated interativelly until we have a nearly perfect data generator, this is, until we get a decoder that produces fake data which cannot be distinguished from the real data.:*\n",
    "                - **Part 1: The generator** A network plays the role of a generator. We input data coming from one well-known distribution such as a Normal distribution and the output is expected to be the type of data we desire, e.g. cat images, words, etc. Just as we saw with the decoder of the Auto-encoder.\n",
    "                - **Part 2: The discriminator** In order for the generator to be able to achieve its goal here comes the clever trick. A discriminator or classifier is trained with data coming from the true source we want to mimick and with the data coming from the generator. These are mixed. And the role of the discriminator is to tell apart real from fake data. \n",

    "        + Examples in different clusters are different (low inter-class similarity)\n",
    "    - We have different clustering techniques: \n",
    "        + **K-means**: *looks at the problem of identifying groups, or clusters of data points in a multidimensional space. Our goal is to partition the space in $K$ clusters. In k-means, the clusters are represented by $k$ prototypes $\\{m^{(k)}\\}$. We may think about these prototypes as the centers of the clusters. K-means then consists of compressing groups into prototypes. It is important that the number of prototypes is fixed a priori, we are stating the number of clusters before the algorithm starts.* The solution of this problem can be done by iterating two steps, in which we solve first for one while keeping the other fixed, and then we optimize the other based on the former solution, called **Expectation Maximization (EM)**, where the expectation step **E** and the maximization step **M** alternates. In this case we may choose an initial value of the prototypes $\\{m^{(k)}\\}$ and then alternate the following steps:\n",
    "            + **Step E:** We minimize the objective with respect to $r_i^{(k)}$ keeping the values of the prototypes fixed.\n",

    "        + **Soft k-means**: *We set a **stiffness parameter** $\\beta$ and we change the assignment rule considering the similarity to each of the means. Observe that the **similarity is now defined with respect to all possible means**, this is each point resebles something to each mean. This will mean that all data contribute to the assignment.*\n",
    "        + **Mixture of Gaussians**: *we conduct the clustering by preassuming that the different prototypes have Gaussian distribution. Each distribution is found by conducting the maximum likelihood of the assumed Gaussian, to determine the corresponding parameters of the distribution.* \n",

    "# 12. Ensemble learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** *Ensemble learning is based on the aggregation of decisions of different classifiers. For ensemble learning to work classifiers must be diverse.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12.1 Decision trees\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision trees** are another kind of intutive **classification strategy based on the divide and conquer paradigm**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic **idea** in decision trees is to partition the space in patches and fit a model in that patch. There are two questions to answer in order to implement this solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ How do we partition the space?\n",
    "+ What model to use in each patch?\n",
    "\n",
    "In classification trees the second question is straight forward, each patch is given the value of a label and all data falling in that part of the space will be predicted as such.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elements of the **decision treen modelling:**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Splits using axis-orthogonal hyperplanes. This is the key that allows \"interpretability\" of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- At each internal node we test a value of a feature. A feature and a threshold are stored for each internal node.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Leaves makes the class prediction. If leaves are pure, we have to store the class label. If leaves are impure, then the fraction of samples for each class is stored and its frequency is returned when queried.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What is great about decision trees?\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Trees are easy for humans to interpret. It can be seen as a set of rules. Each path from root to one leaf of the tree is an AND combination of the thresholded features.\n",
    "+ Given a finite data set, decision trees can express any function of the input attributes. In ${\\bf R}^d$ we can isolate every point in the data set by constructing a box around each of them.\n",
    "+ There can be more than one tree that fits the same data. From all of them we would like a tree with minimum number of nodes. But the problem is NP.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Learning the tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the problem is NP we can resort to a greedy construction algorithm. **Greedy algorithms choose the current best binary partition without taking into account its impact on the quality of subsequent splits**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm idea is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Initialize the algorithm with a node associated to the full data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "**while** the list is not empty\n",
    "1. Retrieve the first node from the list.\n",
    "2. Find the data associated to that node.\n",
    "3. Find a splitting point.\n",
    "4. If the node is splittable, create the nodes linked to the parent node and put them in the exploration list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The splitting criterion\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different splitting criteria. The most common ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Misclassification error\n",
    "+ Gini index\n",
    "+ Cross-entropy/Information gain/Mutual information\n",
    "\n",
    "Withouth going into details, **misclassification error splits greedily selecting the split that corrects more data at each point**. **Gini index** and **cross-entropy** probabilistically model the notion of impurity of a node. The split is chosen so that the **average purity of the new nodes is maximized**. Observe that as we descend in the tree the purity increases and eventually converge to pure leaves. A nice way of thinking about entropy is Pedro Domingos' simile with surprise. Entropy measures the average surprise/information a probabilistic result yields. In a binary variable, the maximum surprise occurs when both outcomes are equally probable, one has the maximum uncertainty on the result. Otherwise, the surprise decreases. This behavior is also display in Gini's index.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trees and overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Because trees are very expressive models they can model any training set perfectly and easily overfit**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways of avoiding overfitting in trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Stop growing the tree when the split is not statistically significant.\n",
    "+ Grow a full tree and post-prune.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simplest ways of post pruning is **reduced error prunning**. It goes like this,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Split data into training and validation\n",
    "2. Create a candidate tree on the training set\n",
    "3. Do until further pruning is harmful\n",
    "    1. Evaluate impact on the validation set of removing each posible node (with descendants)\n",
    "    2. Greedily remove the node that improves the performance the most.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Pruning is not implemented in sklearn at this moment. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 12.2 Introduction to Ensemble learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble learning mimicks one of the human uncertainty reduction mechanism, seeking additional opinions before making a major decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble learning is divided in two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train a set of classifiers\n",
    "2. Aggregate their results\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different reasons for using ensemble learning in practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Statistical reasons:** The combination of outputs of different classifiers may reduce the risk of an unfortunate selection of a poorly performing classifier.\n",
    "2. **Large scale data sets:** It makes little sense to only have one classifier on very large sets of data. Partition data in smaller subsets and aggregate seems like a good idea.\n",
    "3. **Divide and conquer:** Some problems too difficult for a single classifier to solve. The decision boundary may be too complex or lie outside the space of functions of the classifier.\n",
    "4. **Data fusion:** Different source fusion is usually a problem. One usually faces data coming from heterogeneous sources and the question is how to fuse these data. One solution is to train one classifier per source and the fuse the decision of those experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diversity\n",
    "\n",
    "One condition required for the system to work is that errors on different classifiers should be made on different samples in order for the strategic combination of the classifiers to correct possible errors in the judgement of the class o a particular instance. This effect has been called **diversity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diversity can be obtained in different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Using different training sets. Use resampling strategies to obtain different optimal classifiers. This effect is correlated with the notion of stability of the classifier and the concept of bias and variance of the classifier.\n",
    "+ Using different training parameters for different classifiers\n",
    "+ Combining different architectures. (i.e. svm, decission trees, ...)\n",
    "+ Training on different features. (i.e. random subspaces or random projections)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Different kinds of ensemble models\n",
    "\n",
    "From a topological and architectural point of view, we can find three great ways for building an ensemble:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bagging:** Horitzontal aggregation. All elements trained outputs are combined using some aggregation rule. In bagging the elements combined are trained independently. \n",
    "- **Boosting:** Horitzontal aggregation. Each component in the aggregation depends on all the others. In this kind of techniques the two most well known approaches for linking members are the notions of residual (gradient boosting) or statistical resampling (adaptive boosting). \n",
    "- **Stacking:** Vertical aggregation. In this kind of techniques the output of one member of the ensemble is the input for the next member. For example, each layer in a neural network is vertically stacked.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bootstrapping aggregation \n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrapping means **resampling the training data set with replacement**. Usually the same number of data as the original data set is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bootstrapping aggregation (aka. Bagging)** is an ensemble technique that uses **multiple bootstrapped copies of the training set to build a set of classifiers**. One classifier for each bootstrapped training copy. And then, use a combination technique, such as majority voting, in order to take the final decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging performance improvement is due to the **reduction of the variance of the classifier while mantaining its bias**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12.3 Random forest\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** *Random Forest technique introduces a randomization over the feature selected for building  each tree in the ensemble in order to improve diversity in an attempt to reduce variance evan more. Let us code this variant of bagging.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12.4 Incremental learning: stage-wise approximation and boosting techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to now we have seen optimization techniques based on full step optimisation (e.g. gradient descent approaches). This is, we optimise all members of the ensemble at each step. We will now consider **stage-wise approximations** or incremental approximations. The most simple approach of this family is a greedy stage-wise approximation. In stage-wise approximations *we consider the model up to our current time $t$ as fixed, and we just add and optimize a new element of the ensemble.*\n",

    "\n",
    "There are very few models that intrinsically handle the multi-class case. By intrinsically handling the multi-class problem I am referring to methods in which we do not have to worry about how many classes our problem has. The two big families of models that can deal with the problem are\n",

But *we have to worry about how many classes there are*. In particular *we have to build a model for each class and then take a maximum score/probability/confidence among the predictions*. This way of addressing the multiclass problem is also known as **one-against-all** because *we consider one model for each class while the samples from the rest of the classes are considered as negative samples*. This is the first example of a reductionist framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **reductionist framework** refers to those *ensemble methods that allow to reduce the multi-class problem to a set of binary problems*. In a $K$ class problem, the two most common approaches in this framework are:\n",

    "\n",
    "## 12.6 Error correcting output coding\n",
    "\n",
    "Error correcting output coding is a generalization of the methods shown before. In the most general case each class is assigned a ternary code $c_i \\in \\{+1,0,-1\\}^l$ with length $l$. This step is called **coding**. In testing a new sample will be given a test code and this will be compared according to some distance to the class codewords.
