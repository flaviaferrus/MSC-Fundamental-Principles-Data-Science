(It’s even been said that if people could see in high dimensions machine learning would not be necessary.) But in high dimensions it’s hard to understand what is happening. This in turn makes it difficult to design a good classifier. Naively, one might think that gathering more features never hurts, since at worst they provide no new information about the class. But in fact their benefits may be outweighed by the curse of dimensionality.\n",
    "Fortunately, there is an effect that partly counteracts the curse, which might be called the “blessing of non-uniformity.” In most applications examples are not spread uniformly throughout the instance space, but are concentrated on or near a lower-dimensional manifold. For example, k-nearest neighbor works quite well for handwritten digit recognition even though images of digits have one dimension per pixel, because the space of digit images is much smaller than the space of all possible images. Learners can implicitly take advantage of this lower effective dimension, or algorithms for explicitly reducing the dimensionality can be used."
