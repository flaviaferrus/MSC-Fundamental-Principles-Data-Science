# Master's in Fundamental Principles of Data Science at UB

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to my Master's program in Fundamental Principles of Data Science at UB. In this repository, you will find a collection of my coursework, projects, and research from my academic journey. This repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio of my work, showcasing my dedication to mastering the main basis and principles from the different areas of data science.


## About the Program

In our increasingly data-driven world, vast amounts of information are generated daily, spanning personal and professional domains, from online transactions to research and financial activities. Yet, without proper monitoring and interpretation, this data remains devoid of value. Data scientists are the new-age professionals at the intersection of mathematics and computer science.

This Master's program in Fundamental Principles of Data Science is designed to equip the students with the theoretical and practical foundations required for accurate data modeling and analysis, as well as the professional skills needed to tackle data-driven projects. The curriculum places a strong emphasis on understanding the fundamental algorithms that underpin data science. 

As a result, the course covers a broad spectrum of topics, including computational algebra, optimization, probabilistic programming, machine learning, deep learning, recommendation systems, natural language processing applications, time series analysis, and support for infrastructures handling big data. All the material from the different courses are presented on this GitHub repository, for your use and learnings. 



## Repository Structure

This repository is organized to provide easy navigation through my academic journey. In each case, the materials are organized in folders named after the subject coursed. Each separate directory follows the same structure:

- **[Coursework](/Coursework):** This directory contains notes, assignments, and materials from various courses I took during my Master's program.

- **[Projects](/Projects):** Here, you can explore the data science projects I completed during my studies. Each project includes detailed documentation and code.

- **[Research](/Research):** This section showcases my research papers, further information outside the course guide or any contributions I made to the field of data science during my Master's program (if it applies).
