    "Assume we start with these 4 partitions, because spark remembers how the data is created it can recreate the partitions. Tt does not remember scates?\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an issue on this approach:\n",
    "- Since it does not remember data, it only remembers the steps, we would need to store the RDD 2 in memory, from the Example of RDD lieange, so we do not have to export the data and transform it again each time\n",

    "\n",
    "Everything in RDD is either a transformation or an action. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "We get an error file, which has the form seen on the slide. \n",
    "- Filter is a transformation, getting just the error lines\n",
    "- Coalesce is a transformation\n",
    "- Count() is an action on the data\n",
    "- Collect() action gives us the whole data. We usually do not collect. \n",
    "When an action happens, then all the transformation happen, not until that moment. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple RDD transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "- map functions apply to all of the rows of the data. \n",
    "    - mappartition applies the function to a partition from the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Value pairRDD\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a input file (server log file), and we read it, and then we split it by , thus we get a pairRDD with the keys and the values (like a dict). \n",
    "\n",
    "## RDD Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an action we can do in python but we cannot do in RDD: there is no concept of index, we cannot do a full loop on the indexs of the rows or cols. No indexs are used, we would need to apply the map function. "
