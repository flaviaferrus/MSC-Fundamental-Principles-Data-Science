I.e. this decision could be taken from any unknown person (this is what means from the **point of view of the ignorance**. This comes from the **consequences** of actions: **Utilitarians**!\n",
    "    - The assurance of basic necessities and the opportunity to do better would form the foundation for social and political justice and provide the ability for people to assert themselves.\n",
    "- John Locke (**Libertarians**): individuality at the extreme, individualistic point of view. \n",
    "    -  A man had a right to live for himself and an **individual’s happiness cannot be prescribed by another man or any number of other men**\n",
    "    -  Libertarianism holds that the basic moral concepts are **individual rights** and that the rights to be respected are noninterference rights. These generally fall under the heading of rights to life, to **liberty or to property**.\n",
    "    -  For libertarianism, the only proper limit to one person's enjoyment of these rights is his or her duty to respect the similar rights of others.\n",
    "- John Stuart Mill (**Utilitarians**): you should make decisions always from the point of views of the **greatest good for the greatest number**:\n",
    "    - Utilitarian calculus opens up the possibility that in situations such as a pandemic, some people might justly be sacrificed for the greater good. It would benefit society to accept casualties.\n",
    "- Michael Sandel (**Communitarians**): Everyone derives their identify from the broader community. **Individual rights count, but not more than community norms**. Justice cannot be determined in a vacuum or behind a veil of ignorance, but must be rooted in society (common good). **First community and then the individuals**. \n",
    "- Marx: radical way of thinking about decisions and society. Emancipation is a key concept.\n"
