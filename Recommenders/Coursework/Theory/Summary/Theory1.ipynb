    "Collaborative filtering models use the collaborative power of the ratings provided by multiple users to make recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of collaborative filtering methods is that these unspecified ratings can be imputed because the observed ratings are often highly correlated across various users and items. This similarity can be used to make inferences about incompletely specified values. Most of the models for collaborative filtering focus on leveraging either inter-item correlations or inter-user correlations for the prediction process. Some models use both types of correlations. Furthermore, some models use carefully designed optimization techniques to create a training model in much the same way a classifier creates a training model from the labeled data. This model is then used to impute the missing values in the matrix, in the same way that a classifier imputes the missing test labels. There are two types of methods that are commonly used in collaborative filtering:\n",
    "- **Memory-based methods** or *neighborhood- based collaborative filtering algorithms*: ratings of user-item combinations are predicted on the basis of their neighborhoods. These neighbours can be defined in two ways:\n",
    "    - **User-based collaborative filtering:** the ratings provided by like-minded users of a target user A are used in order to make the recommendations for A. Thus, the basic idea is to determine users, who are similar to the target user A (**user similarity**), and recommend ratings for the unobserved ratings of A by computing weighted averages of the ratings of this peer group. \n",
    "        - Similarity functions are computed between the rows of the ratings matrix to discover **similar users**.\n",
    "        - the ratings are predicted using the ratings of neighboring users\n",
    "    - **Item-based collaborative filtering:** In order to make the rating predictions for target item B by user A, the first step is to determine a set S of items that are most similar to target item B. The ratings in item set S, which are specified by A, are used to predict whether the user A will like item B. \n",
    "        - Similarity functions are computed between the *columns of the ratings matrix* to discover **similar items**.\n",
    "        - the ratings are predicted using the user's own ratings on neighboring items (closely related)\n",
    "    - *PROS* of memory-based techniques are that they are simple to implement and the resulting recommendations are often easy to explain.\n",
    "    - *CONS* memory-based algorithms do not work very well with sparse ratings matrices\n",
    "- **Model-based methods:** machine learning and data mining methods are used in the context of predictive models.\n",
    "    - Ex: decision trees, rule-based models, Bayesian methods and latent factor models\n",
    "        - Latent factors: Latent factor models are considered to be state-of-the-art in recommender systems. These models leverage well-known dimensionality reduction methods to fill in the missing entries. \n",
    "    \n",

    "Factorization is, in fact, a more general way of approximating a matrix when it is prone to dimensionality reduction because of correlations between columns (or rows). Most dimensionality reduction methods can also be expressed as matrix factorizations. The m × n ratings matrix R is approximately factorized into an m × k matrix U and an n × k matrix V: $R \\approx U V^T$. Each column of U (or V ) is referred to as a latent vector or latent component, whereas each row of U (or V) is referred to as a latent factor. \n",
